-------
You can do one of the following:
* python setup.py install
* copy ggapi to anywhere to your PYTHONPATH (e.g. your project directory)

Usage
-----

You must provide one of the following when creating GG class:

1. code - only when user authorizes your app, GG.pl sends GET request with "code" parameter to your app,
2. access_token, refresh_token - stored in your storage (db, session, etc.) for returning user.

More info on authentication: http://dev.gg.pl/api/pages/ggapi/auth.html (Polish)

Library implements following methods:

*get_user(uin=None)*
    Gets user data from public directory. If uin is None it will get authorized user data.

    Returns dict.

*get_friends(uin=None, limit=1000, last_id=None)*
    Gets friends of user given by uin (if None, authorized user) according to limit and offset (last_id indicates id of previous query last record)

    Returns dict.

*send_notification(user, message, link=None)*
    Send notification to user with message and optional link.
    If user is int it is UIN, it can be "friends" to send to all friends.

    Returns True if notification was send, False otherwise.

    Send event to authorized user dashboard.

            access_token, refresh_token = (...)your logic, e.g. get from SESSION(...)
            gg = GG(client_id=CLIENT_ID, client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET,
